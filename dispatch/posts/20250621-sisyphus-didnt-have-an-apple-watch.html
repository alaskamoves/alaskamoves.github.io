There were no rings to close, no streaks to protect, no passive-aggressive nudges to breathe. He had a rock — and that was enough.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8f3c" name="8f3c">He pushed it, and it fell. He pushed it again. The terms were brutal, but at least they were clear. His sentence was repetition. Ours is repetition <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">with notifications</strong>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2250" name="2250">We, however, live under a different curse: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">optimization</strong>. Our boulders come prepackaged as features. We do not simply push — we <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">log</strong>, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">quantify</strong>, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">gamify</strong>, and then scroll Twitter in the moments between. We don’t resist our sentence — we upgrade it, subscribe to it, sync it across devices.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7193" name="7193">Sisyphus labored in silence. His torment was mythic, but honest. Our labor is constantly <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">interrupted</em> by notifications from mindfulness apps. Our struggle is not with absurdity — it is with <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">distraction dressed as progress</strong>. The pain of pushing a rock is different than the subtle ache of never arriving.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d8a6" name="d8a6">You may not push a rock uphill, but perhaps you check your email first thing in the morning. You don’t descend the mountain — you refresh your feed. The climb never ends, but it’s not because you’re cursed. It’s because you’ve subscribed to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">infinite loops</em> disguised as achievement. The inbox repopulates. The steps reset. The dopamine wears off.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1d55" name="1d55">Unlike Sisyphus, we celebrate our labor. We screenshot it. We filter it. We push and climb not toward awareness, but toward <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">metrics</strong> — likes, shares, KPIs, steps, burned calories. And at the end of the day, the reward is another digital badge. Another prompt. Another hill.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e12b" name="e12b">Sisyphus didn’t track his VO2 max. He didn’t need a recovery score. No metrics informed him of his readiness to resume. His readiness was irrelevant — the gods did not care. The algorithm, however, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">pretends</em> to care deeply. It smiles at you in haptics. It pushes notifications titled “Just checking in.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="29ed" name="29ed">You are not free when your labor is constantly measured. You are not free when your rest must be logged. You are not free when silence is so foreign that you need white noise to simulate it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="22f5" name="22f5">Perhaps Sisyphus was freer than we are. He knew the task, and he knew it was absurd. There was no illusion of productivity, no curated feed of other boulder-pushers with shinier stones and better form. He was condemned, but <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">not deluded</strong>. His rock was real. His struggle, felt. He didn’t need a daily affirmation.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a5fa" name="a5fa">We, on the other hand, mistake our metrics for meaning. We confuse visibility for value. We wear our suffering like a smart device — tightly fitted, always charged, always pinging.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7bca" name="7bca">So yes, imagine Sisyphus happy — but do not imagine him <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">connected</strong>.<br/>Imagine him unmeasured.<br/>Imagine him <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">aware</em>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dabe" name="dabe">And then ask yourself: if you could remove the watch, the feed, the need to be seen — would you still climb?<br/>Would you still push?<br/>Would you know what you’re pushing?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d351" name="d351">Maybe then the absurd becomes clarity. Not a curse, but a chance to start over, quietly.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="c08d" name="c08d">No data. No sync. Just the rock. And you.</p></div></div></section>
