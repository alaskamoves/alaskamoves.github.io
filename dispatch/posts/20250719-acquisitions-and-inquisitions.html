  <h1>Acquisitions and Inquisitions</h1>
  <h3>On the inquiries that led me to acquire.</h3>
  <p>published: 2025-07-19</p>

<p>
    Before I wrote dispatches, I searched—not for answers, but for artifacts I could claim.
    A domain, a vessel, a shortcut to sovereignty. I scrolled where liquidity hides—through listings, backpages, ad credits, and credit revolvers.
    The question, formulated simply: what could I acquire to skip the scaffolding and arrive already anchored?
</p>

<p>
    I wasn’t hunting clients. I was tracking capital. Not chasing tools, but transfer.
    Ready to swipe my way into permanence, if permanence could be bought. Just not, "yet another gig."
    Not a W-2. Not another 1099 that I must hunt down come tax season, because I moved addresses, again. 
</p>

<p>
    That pause rewrote the playbook—not as rejection of acquisition, but its recalibration.
    I stopped asking what I could buy, and started asking what would build back. What would stand if no one showed up.
    What would return signal, not just broadcast noise.
</p>

<p>
    So I spent. Not to flip. Not to scale. But to measure. A modest outlay—matched where it could be—not to buy attention, but to confirm presence.
    To test if the vessel I’d welded could hold meaning under motion. To see if the output of my labour capitalised into an enterprise.
</p>

<p>
    Each acquisition became its own question. Every tool posed a test. Every re-route demanded a response.
    A domain, a dataset, a QR code—they all began to interrogate me. What began as consumption became confrontation.
    What began as a search to acquire, became acquisitions that inquired. They made me question what I was capable of.
</p>

<p>
    Still, others came with documentation that prescribed the actions one ought to perform with said object.
    Yet, there's always the one's I will not hesitate to deploy. Come what may, without these tools, I am useless.
    And without me, my disregarded LLC is useless; just a toolbox collecting rust instead of royalties.
