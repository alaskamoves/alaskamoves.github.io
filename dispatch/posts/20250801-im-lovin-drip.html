  <h1>I'm Lovin' DRIP</h1>
  <h3>In defence of yield, shelter, and the quiet nutritional sovereignty of a drive-thru staple.</h3>
  <p>published: 2025-08-01</p>
  <hr />
  
<p>What follows, is not investment advice. Nor is it to be construed as a solicitation. It is a thesis—archived, not pitched.</p>

<p>
    The decision to place $7,000 (or $5,000 in equivalent holdings through covered calls) into McDonald's Corporation ($MCD) is not based on yield alone.
    It is based on the real and observable function McDonald's serves in the infrastructure of American life.
    This is not a defence of fast food, but of fast yield, slow capital, and sovereign routing in a landscape of dominated by feudal apps.
</p>

<p>
    McDonald's is not a restaurant, nor a burger chain. It's a real estate investment trust (REIT) fronting as a successful franchise.
    A caloric embassy at the corner of labour and logistics. It owns the dirt beneath its treads and the clouds above its chimneys.
    It doesn't merely serve cheeseburgers—<b>it anchors movement</b>.
</p>

<p>
    A modest $600/yearly budget for McDonald's may seem like personal indulgence, but in practice, it is the cost of <b>caloric continuity</b> while in transit.
    A warm shelter, a clean bathroom, an open outlet, a predictable parking layout, and 900 calories bagged at 2,000 RPM.
    This is not consumers discretionary. It is capital and operational expenditure for the general contractor.
</p>

<p>
    And that is just upstream. The pipeline:
    <li>2% back via Apple Pay (cash settled in 24h).</li>
    <li>100-200 McPoints on the dollar.</li>
    <li>Free sides, BOGO coupons, and more.</li>
    <li>A 2.5% dividend yield (on the equity).</li>
    <li>Covered call premiums at 3-8% annualised.</li>
</p>

<p>
    In sum, the hedged position covers one's meal expenses.
    Not as a mere consumer, but as a franchise-sponsored node in an energy grid.
</p>

<p>
    Unlike its competitors, McDonald's owns its corners. That's not metaphor—it is sovereignty.
    Other chains lease. <b>McDonald's plants flags</b>.
    It is a franchisor, but primordially, it is a landholder with guaranteed throughput.
    The land pays rent to the corporation. The corporation pays rent to its shareholders.
    The burger is the cover story that sells the real estate.
</p>

<p>
    Which leads to an important point: the <b>Big Mac Index</b>.
    The metric once used to chastise emerging markets for their low purchasing power.
    Today, in the U.S., a Big Mac costs approximately three-fourths of a minimum wage hour.
    But if one spends consciously—through apps, through equity, through options—it can cost $0.
</p>

<p>
    A DRIP-ped $MCD position, paired with reward points and buy-writes,
    makes McDonald's not just a holding, but a self-replenishing node in a personal logistics stack.
</p>

<p>
    The return is not just financial but also <b>territorial</b>.
    One owns a stake in the only sovereign energy grid with infrastructure present in every zipcode.
    And that's before one even prices in the unquantified yield:
    <li>Time not wasted scouting for restrooms.</li>
    <li>Shelter in stormy conditions.</li>
    <li>Wi-Fi hotspots in dead zones.</li>
    <li>Predictability in the erratic loops of gig labour.</li>
</p>

<p>
    McDonald's still sells burgers, since its conception. But the business model is platform monopolisation.
    And $MCD is the leasehold. $5,000 allocated with a LEAPS hedge is not indulgence.
    It is a measured land grab in the empire of errand-stacking.
</p>

<p>
    Thus: <em>I'm Lovin' DRIP!</em>
</p>

<p>
    These ideas are not meant to be cloned, but peer-reviewed and understood.
    Private equity is still capital.
    And equity seeks equitability—through the streets and on the spreadsheets.
    And equity routed via $MCD, simply DRIPs.
