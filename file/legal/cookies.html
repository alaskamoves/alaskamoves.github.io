    alaskamoves.us does not set, read, store, or embed HTTP cookies of any kind.
    This site does not fingerprint devices, track sessions, or correlate visitor behavior across time.
    If cookies are present in your browser’s storage, they did not originate here.

<p>
    We do not participate in analytics, ad networks, or retargeting campaigns.
    Nor do we engage in silly A/B tests to drive engagement: WYSIWYG.
    This absence is not merely technical—it is philosophical, and operational.
</p>

<p>
    If a time ever comes where minimal storage is introduced
    (e.g., for authenticated access, persistent drafts, or security hardening),
    it will be disclosed here first—in plain text, without euphemism.
</p>

<p>
    For now, rest easy: no cookies are being served. OnlyCrumbs™
