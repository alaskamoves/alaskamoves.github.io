  <h2>DMCA Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    alaskamoves.us operates under the fair assumption that original work deserves its place and its protection.
    If something hosted here violates your rights under Title 17 of the United States Code,
    know that this domain responds in good faith to proper DMCA takedown requests.
  </p>

  <p>
    To file such a notice, send a written claim to the designated agent below, including:
      (1) identification of the copyrighted work,
      (2) identification of the allegedly infringing material and its location,
      (3) your contact information,
      (4) a statement that you believe the use is unauthorized, and
      (5) a sworn statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information is accurate and that you are the rightful owner or authorized to act on their behalf.

    This site does not host user-generated content.
    But should anything here feel wrongly borrowed, rest assured:
    a takedown is easier than a lawsuit, and swifter than a grudge.
