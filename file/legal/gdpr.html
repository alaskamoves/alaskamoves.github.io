<h1>GDPR</h1>

<section id="gdpr">
  <p>
    This site, <strong>alaskamoves.us</strong>, operates in good faith with respect to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
      even though it is neither headquartered in nor explicitly targeting the European Union.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lawful basis for any data handling on this site is <em>voluntary consent</em>.
    No data is collected without the visitor’s deliberate submission.
    None are required to browse the site.
  </p>

  <p>
    No profiling, automated decision-making, or cross-border data transfers occur.
    No third-party analytics, trackers, or cookies are deployed.
    In fact, we actively avoid them.
  </p>

  <p>
    While alaskamoves.us was not built with GDPR in mind, it was built with respect in hand.
    Data is handled lightly, deleted quickly, and treated as something that belongs to you—not us.
  </p>
